</div>

<p class='c006'>The following observations, experiments, and
calculations have been made upon the crops of
Improved Beet Root, grown upon a farm at
Bedfords, in the county of Essex, containing
600 acres, belonging to John Heaton, Esq. and
in his own occupation. The best mode of
cultivating this valuable root, with the greatest
prospect of success, is a subject well worth the
attention of farmers in general, and to those in
particular who have <i>strong soils</i> to cultivate,
and feel the want of green food for their cattle
and sheep in the winter and spring months of
the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the first edition of this little work was
published, the Author has obtained many new
lights upon the subject, which he has either
embodied in the present edition, or published
in an Appendix. The contents show sufficiently
to whom his principal obligation is due, and he
is restrained only by motives of delicacy from
saying more. The circulation of the work was
intended to have been chiefly confined to a few
of the inland counties, but the encouragement
the Author has received, and which he respectfully
acknowledges, has induced him to publish
a fourth edition, for more general circulation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAP. I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The garden at Cheese Cross produced
a fine crop of the Improved Beet Root.
The roots, when about the size of a
radish, were thinned out with a turnip
hoe, leaving the plants nearly 15
inches apart each way. I selected
60 square yards, 6 by 10, and found
the produce to be 360 roots, equal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>29,040 roots upon an acre. They
weighed from 1 pound to 12 pounds
each, and 10 of them, taken up
indiscriminately, weighed 40 pounds.
Supposing them, therefore, to average
4 pounds each, the <i>weight</i> upon an
acre would be something more than 50
tons. One hundred weight, cut into
small pieces for the cattle, measured 2
bushels. The <i>quantity</i> per acre may
therefore be estimated at 2000 bushels,
2 bushels are given to each bullock
daily: 196 bushels, the produce of
only about a tenth part of an acre of
garden ground, planted in this way,
would keep a bullock 14 weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>In Mason’s field, on the road from
Bedfords to Havering, another fine
crop was obtained. The roots, when
about the size of a radish, were taken
out of the seed bed, and planted in
rows, 3 feet asunder, and the plants
were about 18 inches apart in each
row. I selected 60 square yards, 6 by
10, and found the produce to be 126
roots, equal to 10,164 roots upon an acre.
These roots weighed, on an average, 5
pounds each, so that the weight upon
an acre would be something more than
22 tons. Each bullock eats 1 cwt. per
day. The produce of 1 acre of ground,
planted in this way, would keep 4
bullocks feeding for 110 days.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>In another part of the same field,
on the road from Bedfords to Havering,
the seed was dibbled in rows, 2 feet
apart, and the plants were left 12 inches
apart in each row. I selected 60
square yards, 6 by 10, and found the
produce to be 270 roots; equal to
21,780 roots upon an acre. These
roots average a little more than 5
pounds each. The weight upon an
acre would therefore be something more
than 48 tons. Each bullock eats 1 cwt.
per day. The produce of 1 acre of
land, planted in this way, would keep

<p class='c006'>This is the third year that Mr. Heaton
has cultivated the improved Beet Root
with great success, in three different
ways; namely, broadcast on ground
under garden culture; and, in the field,
by dibbling in the seed, and transplanting
the roots. The result fully justifies
a preference in favour of dibbling in
rows 2 feet apart, as will be seen by
the following short statement of the
produce obtained under each mode of
culture.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>A good crop may be obtained by
the broadcast method upon deep, loose
soils, or upon strong soils spade-trenched,
10 or 12 inches deep; but by that mode
much seed is wasted, and much extra
expence incurred in labour, hoeing, and
transplanting, before the plants are
placed 5 inches apart each way,
which is very material to insure a good
crop, under that mode of culture.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>To those who may have been in the
habit of cultivating the Swedish turnip,
it may be desirable to point out the
advantages which the improved Beet
Root has over that turnip. Mr. Heaton
had last year, in his Havering Green
field, the best crop of Swedish turnips
that I have ever seen, upon his farm,
during twelve years’ attention to the
management of it; and his intelligent
agent and farmer, Mr. Henry Gibbons,
assures me, that he did not see a better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>crop between London and Derby, from
which latter place he returned in December
last.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Swedes in this field were drilled
in rows 24 inches apart, and the plants
were left about 9 inches apart in each
row. I selected 60 square yards, 6 by
10, and found the produce to be 252
turnips, equal to 20,356 upon an acre.
I weighed many of them, and found
them from half a pound to 6 pounds
each, averaging 2 pounds. The weight
upon an acre would, therefore, be
something more than 18 tons: <i>less</i> by 30
tons than the produce of an acre of the
improved Beet, dibbled in rows 2 feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>apart, and the plants left 12 inches apart
in each row.</p>

<p class='c007'>The improved Beet has other material
advantages over turnips. The crop is
more certain, as the infant root is not
injured by the fly; the ground may
be cleared in time to sow wheat upon
it, and the Beet attaining perfection, as
it does, before the winter sets in, much
labour and all the difficulty of getting
and carting turnips in bad weather are
saved to the farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bushel of the sliced Beet weighs
6 pounds heavier than a bushel of
Swede turnip sliced. Two bushels of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>per day satisfies a bullock better than 2
bushels and a half of Swedes; and it is
well known, that 2 bushels and a half
of Swedes are better than 3 bushels of
common turnips. Sheep are fond of
the improved Beet after Christmas; so
are pigs, young cattle, and cows; and,
with hay or straw, it will be found
excellent food for young horses. For
milch cows, the Beets have a decided
advantage over turnips. Turnips, from
their rankness, spoil the cream and
butter; Beet, from its peculiar sweetness,
improves both.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is strongly recommended to the
farmers near London to cultivate this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>root, and to the cowkeepers in London
to consume it: to them it will be found
of great value.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the above was written, the
Author has been favoured with the following
information, from a Friend, who
left his crop in the ground till spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Beet in the Old Yard has stood
the late severe frost better than any
common turnips, and perhaps equally
well with the Swedes, very few indeed
being injured. Some of them were
covered with snow, but others were exposed.
They were rather small, having
been planted so late as June.” I. K.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>For the information and guidance of
those occupiers of land, who may be
desirous of cultivating the improved
Beet Root upon strong land, the next
Chapter will contain a particular account
of the method used in cultivating
that root upon strong land at Bedfords.
The method there stated, is that which
has been found, on three years’ trial, to
be least expensive in the beginning,
and most profitable in the end.—The
cultivation of this root is earnestly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>recommended to the attention of all
persons farming strong lands with a
view to profit. It should never be
forgotten, that 48 tons, the produce of
only a single acre, of this root, will make
10 bullocks fat enough for the butcher;
and that 6 acres, of equal produce,
will fatten 60 bullocks; that the profit
on each bullock will be considerable;
and that when the business of feeding is
over, the yard will be full of rich dung:
neither should it be forgotten, that
the tenant who sells his straw, cannot
partake of any of these advantages.</p>

<p class='c007'>In proof of this assertion, the following
facts are submitted for consideration:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Mr. Heaton bought two lean Welch
bullocks, at Harlow Bush Fair, on the
9th of September. They cost together
£34. They were pastured on the
Rowens till the 20th of November
following, when they were tied up, and
fed with Beet Root and oat straw till
the 9th of February following, when
they were sold together, in Romford
market, for the sum of £50; yielding
in twenty-two weeks, a profit of £16,
which is equal to 7s. 3d. per week, for
each bullock.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two bullocks were tied up
twelve weeks each, in which time they
ate eight tons 2 cwt. of Beet Root, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>produce of only one-sixth part of an
acre of land, cultivated according to the
method recommended in the following
chapter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAP. V.<br> <span class='large'>THE METHOD USED IN THE CULTIVATION OF THE IMPROVED BEET ROOT UPON STRONG LAND AT BEDFORDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It may be proper, in the first place,
to state what is meant by strong land.
The surface soil is loamy, and from 4 to
12 inches deep, upon a bed of strong
clay mixed with gravel. It is too heavy,
and generally too wet, in the winter,
even for sheep to eat a crop of turnips
on the ground; and although good turnips
are grown upon it, it is always necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>to draw them for the sheep, stall-fed
cattle, or for cattle in the yards. The
ground is prepared to receive the seed,
and cleaned in the same way as it would
have been for Swedish turnips. As
that part of the business is so well known
to all farmers, it is not necessary to enter
into detail upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the middle, or latter end of the
month of April, the furrows are set out
with the plough, 2 feet apart, and double
ploughed; that is, the plough returns
on the furrow to the point whence it
set out, forming a ridge between each
furrow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Double ploughing with a common
plough is preferred to single ploughing
with a double mould board plough,
because it affords a greater depth of
loose earth than the double mould
board plough would produce.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these furrows, the manure, which
should be in a rotten state, is deposited,
after the rate of six cubic yards to an
acre.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ridges are then split by the
plough going and returning the same
way as before mentioned, leaving the
manure immediately under the middle
of the new ridges, A light roller is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>then passed along the ridges, in the
middle of which the seed is dibbled, so
that the plants may receive all the
benefit which can be derived from the
manure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The seed is deposited about an inch
deep whilst the moisture is fresh in
the earth, and covered by drawing a
garden rake along the rows.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, the light roller is again
passed along the ridges, and the work
is finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the plants are about the size
of a radish, they are hoed with a turnip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>hoe, leaving the plants in the rows
about 12 inches apart. If any of the
seeds fail, and there happen not to be
an even crop, the roots, where they
are too thick, are drawn out before the
hoeing takes place, and transplanted,
to fill up the vacant places, and insure
a full crop, which is always certain,
inasmuch as 99 plants out of 100,
thrive and do well. In transplanting,
care is necessary to prevent the point
of the root from turning upwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weeds, whilst the plants are
young, are kept hoed, but after the
head of the plant has once spread, no
weed can live underneath its shade, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the expence of hoeing afterwards is
very trifling indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole of the crop is taken up
in the month of November, in dry
weather. The tops are cut off <i>near</i>
the <i>crown</i> of the plants, and the plants,
when perfectly dry, are piled up in a
shed, and covered with straw sufficiently
thick to preserve them from the frost.
They kept last year till the latter end
of March, and they would have kept
much longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The seed may be had of Cochran,
seedsman, in Duke Street, Grosvenor
Square; of Messrs. Gibbs and Co.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Half Moon Street, Piccadilly; and of
Mr. Mason, Fleet Street. From 3 to 4
pounds of the seed will be sufficient
for an acre of ground, prepared and
dibbled according to the method here
stated. The price last year was 7s.
per pound, but it may probably be
less hereafter, as the growers of the
root, so long as that high price continues,
will of course save their own seed, and
thereby lessen the demand from the
seedsman.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAP. VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It will not be supposed, by any
intelligent farmer, that where the
quantity of the Improved Beet Root
given daily to a bullock is stated, it is
meant that it should be given without
dry food. It may, however, be
necessary to say, that the same dry
food must be given with the Beet as is
usually given with turnips. Mr. Heaton
last year gave oat straw only, and the
bullocks did well upon that food, and
were sold to profit. No doubt they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>would have been ready for the butcher
sooner, had good hay been given to
them: but this fact may be relied upon,
that fresh bullocks, fed upon the Beet
Root and oat straw, will, in 3 months
time, get fat enough for the butcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may also be necessary to observe,
that not a word, here stated, is intended
to apply to such light turnip soils
as will bear the trampling of sheep,
without injury to the land. Mr. Heaton
has none such upon his farm, and I
have not sufficient knowledge of the
management of turnip land, of that
description, to say, whether prudence
would warrant any trial of the Beet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Root upon a large scale, on such soil,
to be eaten on the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where a field, selected for a crop of
Beet, happens to be in a foul state, the
seed had better be sown in a garden,
and the whole field planted with the
young Beet, when of the size of a
radish. This will give time for cleaning
the ground, and fitting it for a crop;
for, although the Beets are destroyers
of weeds, it is not meant to recommend
the sowing them on foul ground, or in
any way to encourage a slovenly
system of farming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although manure has been used in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the cultivation of this root, it is not
absolutely necessary; and, if not in a
rotten state, it does mischief. Good
crops have been obtained at Bedfords
<i>without manure</i>, and without injury to
the succeeding crops of corn. Beet is
fed from a depth considerably below
the reach of the plough, as generally
used; so that it does not draw the
surface soil in which corn is fed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The method of cultivating the Beet
Root here recommended, is the same as
that which is used in the cultivation of
turnips, in Northumberland and other
parts of the north, with this exception,
that the rows there are 27 inches apart.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>There may be reasons in the north for
still preferring that space, but in Essex
the effect of it, in the cultivation of Beet
Root, would be, that, instead of 48 tons
per acre, 43 tons only would be
obtained. Experience has proved, that
the roots do not get to a larger size in
rows 3 feet apart, than they do in rows
2 feet apart. It may, therefore, fairly
be presumed, that they would not be
larger in rows 27 inches apart; and
if not larger, the weight of the crop, per
acre, must be less, because the plants
decrease in number as the rows increase
in space.</p>

<p class='c007'>The advantages that would arise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>from the cultivation of these roots, upon
a small part of every strong-land-farm
throughout the kingdom, must be
obvious. Calculations might be given
that would astonish and almost exceed
the belief of most readers. Such
calculations, however, in general, are
but little attended to, and it is thought
better to omit them, hoping that enough
has been said upon the subject, to fix
the attention of every person interested
in the cultivation of land.</p>

<p class='c018'>For the last four winters I have
constantly fed my milch cows with
Beet, but I never exceeded, I believe,
a bushel per day to each; not from any
apprehension of ill effects when given
in larger quantities. My object was,
to make it last the longer, as the milk
and cream were evidently much improved
thereby. The cows always had
plenty of hay with the Beet, and when
the weather, or rather the state of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>land would admit, they were turned
into a grass field adjoining my farm
yard.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Turney, of Sedgbrook, who has
finished off some bullocks this Autumn,
whilst at grass, with Beet, has given it
with great good effect to his milch
cows for the last two winters, and he
is at this time keeping a new-calved
heifer upon it.</p>

<p class='c019'>I may add, that I have always found
the milk to be increased in quantity,
as well as improved in quality, whilst
the Beet was used.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>As to the weight of my crop, this
year, it is much less than usual. My
land, you know, is old garden ground,
and produced a crop of Beet last year,
Swedes the year before, and carrots in
1811. A tenacious loam, on clay,
difficult to work in the Spring. On
this I got only 7 cwt. 2 qrs. on 6 yards
by 10, which is after the rate of 30

<p class='c018'>Herewith you receive my
report of a small piece of land, planted
with Mangel Wurzel by Colonel
Elliott. I have been as correct as
possible, and have to observe, that I
think the culture of it well worth the
attention of every farmer.</p>

<p class='c019'>The latter end of April, 1814, ten
poles of land were sown with Mangel
Wurzel, 20 inches distance, in drills;
the plants in the row thinned to about
15 inches. The land poor, consisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>principally of brick rubbish and road
scrapings, with a slight coat of <i>rotten
dung</i> previous to the sowing. It had
two hoeings after the plants were thinned.
The plants in two of the rows,
about the centre of the piece, were set
out 2 feet apart, but these were not
larger than where they were at 15
inches.</p>

<p class='c019'>On the 8th of November the whole
crop was taken up, and, after cutting
off the heads, were packed up in a loft.
To prevent any incorrectness in calculating
the weight by the number of the
roots, the whole crop was weighed,
which amounted to 3 tons, 1 cwt. 56
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>pounds, which is according to the rate
of 49 tons 4 cwt. per acre. A large
portion of the roots weighed from 7 lbs.
to 12 lbs. each. When the rows were
first thinned, some other pieces were
planted with the spare plants, but
these did not succeed so well: they
were much less than the others.</p>

<p class='c019'>Hogs are remarkably fond of this
root, and thrive very fast with it: cows
are also very eager after both leaves
and root. Colonel Elliott began feeding
his cows with the Mangel Wurzel in
July; the weather being very dry, we
were very short of grass. We began
with the leaves, and soon after with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>roots of two pieces, which were transplanted.
The cows looked well and
increased in their milk, and were
partially fed with the roots till the crop
was taken up. The roots were then
sliced, and as much of them given to
the cows (with a little hay) as they
could eat; the milk increased immediately,
and the cows improved in flesh.</p>

<p class='c019'>My opinion is, that the Mangel
Wurzel is a most valuable article of
food to the farmer; because, in a
severe winter, when turnips are in
general destroyed, these roots, properly
stacked in a dry place, and covered so
as to prevent severe frosts from injuring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>them, will be a certain supply of
nutricious and fattening food, (if cultivated
in sufficient quantity) until the
spring grass is fit to turn in upon. I
should conceive, if the seed is put into
the ground in the month of May, after
the manner practised in drilling turnips
on ridges, that no doubt can be
entertained of obtaining a full crop.
As Mangel Wurzel exceeds all other
winter food, from being preserved under
cover without injuring the quality, so it
will prevent a recurrence to the
expensive food of oil cake or corn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Having presented one of your
books to Mr. Richard Laycock, a
considerable farmer and cowkeeper at
Holloway, with a request that he would
cultivate the root, he did me the
favour to make choice of a piece of
land, containing 1 rood and 20 perches,
which had been part of a field, composed
of brick earth or strong clay,
in the procurement of which, the field
had for several years past been dug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>over to a great depth below the original
surface. On this piece he caused a
quantity of soil and rotten dung
intermixed therewith to be laid, and
the ground levelled, about 10 or 12
inches deep. In the month of May
he commenced dibbling the seed in
rows 2 feet asunder, and 1 foot apart
in the rows; but, for want of time,
only about one third part of the crop
was got in by this mode. The remainder
was transplanted in the middle of June.
The whole of the land was kept perfectly
clean, and, while confined to the upper
soil, the plants made rapid progress.
Had the subsoil been of a yielding
nature, the crop would have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>extraordinary; but it was observable,
although the tap roots were particularly
vigorous, that so soon as they had
penetrated to the unbroken clay, they
invariably divided and turned off in a
horizontal direction, and afterwards
threw out fibrous shoots without number.
The seed was procured from a nurseryman
at Fulham, and was particularly
good. Very few of the plants ran up
to seed; those that did so, were not
suffered to remain, but were taken up
and given to the cows, as were also the
lower leaves, which were repeatedly
stripped off in considerable quantities.
In the middle of November the whole
crop was drawn off and weighed, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>being cleared of the tops and loose dirt.
The produce was 15 tons and a few
pounds over, average weight of the
roots, 5¾ pounds. Correspondent
produce 40 tons per acre.</p>

<p class='c019'>Although this experiment on Mr.
Laycock’s land falls short of those
stated in your Treatise, yet, when the
extreme unfavourableness of its situation
is considered, that of an exhausted
brickfield, the deficiency is easily
accounted for. Indeed I cannot help
thinking its result such, as to hold out
considerable temptation to occupiers
of strong clay farms, whereon turnips
cannot successfully be cultivated, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>make trial of a root, which, with
previous winter plowing, promises
more profit than can be obtained from
any other crop that I know of<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The
increase of live stock and radical
improvements of such farms must
necessarily follow.</p>

<p class='c018'>I have for your information
weighed and taken a pretty accurate
account of my small crop of Mangel
Wurzel, which I have lately gathered
out of a garden belonging to my farm.
The length of the garden is 62 yards;
and the breadth of the part sown 12
yards, and the produce, according to
my firm belief and best calculation, is
4 tons, 6 cwt. 40 pounds, and I am
well convinced in my own mind, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>had I properly attended to the culture
of this root, I might have obtained a
much greater produce, even in that
space of ground; for, you will observe,
I have not strictly adhered to the plan
laid down in your little publication.
In the first instance, the ground was
very foul at the time of sowing, and the
plants, when growing, were about 18
inches apart one way, and nearly one
yard the other; there being only 13
rows in the space of 12 yards, and the
garden too surrounded with trees, so
that I consider every thing was
unfavourable. I further beg leave to
state as my opinion, that as the ground
is very strong, it is not well adapted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the growth of Beet, and as most of the
roots were transplanted, they had not a
fair chance.</p>

<p class='c019'>Transplanted roots are seldom so
good as those which have not been
removed. I have given Beet Root, for
two years past, both to feeding and
milch cows with good effect.</p>

<p class='c018'>My Beet Root this year was
sown upon light dry limestone land, of
good quality, perfectly clean, but in a
high situation and cold climate. The
seed was partly sown in beds a yard
and a half in width, partly drilled, and
partly dibbled in ridges at the distance
of 28 inches, and the plants left 12
inches apart after hoeing. The rows
drilled came up much the best, and
continued altogether the finest plants.
They were thinned and hoed early.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The dibbled seed missed in a great
number of places<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a>; the vacancies were
supplied from the drilled rows, transplanted
at different ages, and at different
times of the year, (as the season suited
for the purpose,) but none of them
grew in size or luxuriance<a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a> equal to
those left standing in the drilled rows.
In the beds the plants were extremely
numerous, but they had not the same
advantages of being thinned and hoed
so early as the drilled rows, and they
were in general small in size.</p>

<div class='footnote c017' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Probably planted too deep.—<span class='sc'>Editor.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c019'>I had a most productive supply of
green food to the fold yard, during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>months of September and October, from
the tops, and during the latter month
many of the plants which had run to
seed, were also taken up and consumed
in the same way. They were given to
milch cows morning and evening,
during milking time, and to store pigs
in the fold yard.</p>

<p class='c019'>The produce on 6 yards by 10 was
206 roots in number, and 477 pounds
in weight, to which may be added about
one-tenth more for plants consumed
before the crop was taken up.</p>

<p class='c019'>I think the Beet Root affords a very
material increase to the stock of green
food, of the best quality in the Autumn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>months, and, when grown near enough
to the farm yard to be taken daily as
wanted, without too great an expence
in labour and carriage, that mode of
consuming the leaves and some of the
roots may be resorted to with great
advantage, and it may be found a
resource of no small use in dry seasons.</p>

<p class='c019'>Cattle in general eat both the root
and top with eagerness. Pigs prefer
them to any other vegetable food. I
have occasionally given the roots in
winter to horses, and particularly to
brood mares and to foals, with hay,
and they have invariably done well.</p>

been received by the author from
gentlemen residing in different parts of
the kingdom, recommending, from
their own experience and success, the
culture of the improved Beet Root, to
those farmers who have yet to learn its
value. In so doing, they are not
actuated by any sordid motive or selfish
principle. To do good to others is
their aim, and to promote the public
welfare the utmost of their ambition.</p>
